 

OVERVIEW
DEFINITION:  hack-a-thon : also called "hack day", "hackfest" and "codefest" is a design sprint event where people of all professions (programmers, project managers, designers, writers, etc) collaborate on project ideation and creation. It's not necessary that everyone feel comfortable working directly with swagger files to make the integrations. Each Exchange card needs a title, description of what it is and how it works, links, pictures, etc. Other things that could be created are contributions to the docs site, draft blog posts, etc. So it really can be something that everyone in the company contributes to. Additionally each team will be required to prepare a 10-15 min presentation to be demo'd at the end of Day 2. 

THEME
THEME: The 2018 Exosite Hackathon will be rallied around the idea of building an "ecosystem" around our product family by focusing on building new integrations in Exchange or by adding or improving any other capabilities that can help us expand the ecosystem around our product portfolio. 

This year’s hackathon will leverage Exosite’s latest version of Exchange which allows the ability to publish third party services like Slack, Salesforce and Auth0!

Goal is to actually have teams create integrations that are fully published on Exchange as a third party service – not just dev/staging. Examples would be existing integrations that you can find on Exchange like Slack, Auth0 or Dark Sky.  

Here are some example projects to get you thinking:

Create a solution that uses an existing service on Exchange to do an interesting thing.
Create a new integration and publish on Exchange and show a simple example solution (application or product) that uses it.
Create documentation for the Exchange card, how-to-guide, or draft a blog post for existing or new Exchange elements
Make a contribution to ExoEdge, ExoSense, ExoHome, ExoFleet, or Exosite Insights that makes it easier for ecosystem partners (system integrators, value-added resellers, etc.) to engage or add value
Create a story/presentation/documentation around a possible integration or feature set that would drive ecosystem value for Exosite. If you don't create a functional integration or feature set that works, then make sure to include good info about how we would go to market, engage our partners, and how it would add value for Exosite
